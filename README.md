I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

## Pandas Introduction
Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame that are ideal for working with structured data such as CSV files, Excel sheets, SQL tables, and more. Pandas is widely used in data analysis, data cleaning, and data preprocessing tasks.

**Key Features**
- DataFrame: A two-dimensional table-like data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). It is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.
- Series: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type. It is like a column in a DataFrame.
- Data Input/Output: Pandas supports reading and writing data from various file formats like CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more.
- Data Cleaning: Pandas provides methods to handle missing data, duplicate data, and perform data normalization.
- Data Manipulation: You can filter, sort, group, aggregate, and pivot data using Pandas.
- Statistical Functions: Pandas offers a wide range of statistical functions for data analysis.
- Time Series: Pandas has excellent support for working with time series data.
